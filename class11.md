Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:

1. SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)
whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database.
  
2.SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores. 
  
3. SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
  
4. SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
  
5. SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. 
   In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. 
  
   	 
What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are perfectly suited for storing and processing structured data
Give a real world example - Investing apps.
   
What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL databases are often better suited to storing and modeling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data in one database.
  
Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
  
Which type of database is best for scalability?
For scalability: In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable.
  
##Things I want to know more about
I am not very clear about the concept of nosql vs sql. I would like to know more about them.
