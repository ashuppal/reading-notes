Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?

The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes 
in significant numbers.

Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
It mattered because they were already familiar with computers and computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

When are diversity efforts most successful?
Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. 
Meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. 

Why do diverse companies perform better?
Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
