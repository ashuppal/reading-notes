**CRUD Basics**

Which HTTP method would you use to update a record through an API?
To update a record through an API we will use PUT

Which REST methods require an ID parameter?
DELETE

Whatâ€™s the relationship between REST and CRUD?(w3schools.com)
CRUD is a way of manipulating information, describing the function of an application. REST is controlling data through HTTP commands.

If you had to describe the process of creating a RESTful API in 5 steps, what would they be?
1. Define your requirements
2. design the API architecture
3. Detail its responses and error messages
4. build the endpoint
5. test and document it.

**Things I want to learned more about:
Updating database from changes made from client side.
