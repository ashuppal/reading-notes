This topic is important as Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting.

**Functional Programming Concepts

What is functional programming?
Functional programming is a programming style of building the structure and elements of computer programs that 
treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
Pure function returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
It does not cause any observable side effects.

What are the benefits of a pure function?
It does not cause any observable side effects.The code’s definitely easier to test and we don’t need to mock anything.

What is immutability?
When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created.

What is Referential transparency?
When we have pure functions and immutable data, it gives us referential transparency.

**Node JS Tutorial for Beginners #6 - Modules and require()

What is a module?
In computer software, a module is an extension to a main program dedicated to a specific function. 
In programming, a module is a section of code that is added in as a whole or is designed for easy reusability.

What does the word ‘require’ do?
require() is a built-in function to include external modules that exist in separate files. 
require() statement basically reads a JavaScript file, executes it, and then proceeds to return the export object.

How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
We bring another module into the file the we are working in by using module.export and then assigning it the file/method we want.

What do we have to do to make a module available?
We need to export the module for it to be available.

##Things I want to know more about
As I am not familar with node js, I would like to learn more about modules and exporting and reusing them.
