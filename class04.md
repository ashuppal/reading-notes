This topic is important as we will always be using forms or will take input from the user in one way or another and it is important to understand how that works in React.

**React Docs - Forms**

What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React this way is called a “controlled component”.

Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
In React, form data is usually handled by the components. When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state. You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.

How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
We can control what user is entering by giving some attributes to the input field. For e.g. if we give typr= "text" then the user can only entered text in the input field.

**The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained**

Why would we use a ternary operator?
A ternary operator evaluates a condition and executes a block of code based on the condition. The ternary operator evaluates the test condition. If the condition is true , expression1 is executed. If the condition is false , expression2 is executed.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

(x === y) ? console.log('true') : console.log('false');
