This topic matters as Node JS allows developers for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser. 
  That enables developers to share some code and allows one team to work on the whole application.
  
**An Introduction to Node.js on sitepoint.com**

What is node.js?
Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
  
In your own words, what is Chrome’s V8 JavaScript Engine?
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome. 
It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute.
  
What does it mean that node is a JavaScript runtime?
This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. 

What is npm?
npm is the package manager for the Node JavaScript platform. 
  
What version of node are you running on your machine?
v16.13.0
  
What version of npm are you running on your machine?
8.1.0
  
What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?
npm install -g jshint

What is node used for?
Node allows developers to write JavaScript code that runs directly in a computer process itself instead of in a browser.
 
**6 Reasons for Pair Programming **

What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
I think pair programming helps with work environment readiness as you will be working witha team with all level of experience and pair programming can prepare you for that.
  
How does pair programming work?
Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. 
The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. 
Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.
The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. 
The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs.
